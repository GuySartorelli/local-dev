# Todo

- New command for database stuff
  - restore [file]
    - copy file up to mariadb container
    - inside the mariadb container: `zcat $FILE | mysql -p SS_mysite && rm $FILE`
- For up --pr make sure PR's dependencies are respected - but make sure there's a way to use the current way of adding PRs after create-proj
  - enforce a no-install on the create-project
  - Update composer.json with the appropriate [repositories](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#vcs) config
    - You'll need a read-only github token that composer can use. Consider the below resources
    - https://www.previousnext.com.au/blog/managing-composer-github-access-personal-access-tokens
    - https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/handling-private-packages.md#security
  - Update composer.json to use the PR branch aliased as the original constraint (e.g. "dev-pulls/4.11/the-pr as 4.11.x-dev")
  - After all PRs are added to composer.json, do a `composer install --prefer-source --no-interaction`
- If a PR is for a version we're not currently installing, panic.
  - e.g. interactive "the PR you want is for x.y, but you're installing a.b. Continue installing? Your PR won't be checked out, you'll have to do that manually."
- Set up a composer plugin or similar that does git-set-remotes on everything during install.
- Git commands
  - Set origins (make git-set-remotes a command here instead)
  - Create me a new PR branch
    - "pulls/$CURRENT_BRANCH/$DESCRIPTION"
  - Push the current PR branch
    - Runs phpcs linting
    - Checks for correct naming convention
    - Pushes to creative-commoners by default
- Set up a meta web server
  - basic page showing available projects with some basic info (url, mailhog, php version, etc)
  - phpmyadmin or similar to manage db
- Stop relying on 000-default.conf
  - Have a new placeholder 000-default.conf which just outputs some "this is the default page" message
  - Update what is current docker_apache_default to be a specific virtualhost for the specific site
- ??
